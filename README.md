A few friends who happen to work in open data & technology discover they are both working on projects with school systems.

The school systems both want to export data from their Student Information Systems. They want to use that data to build tools that let them find new insights and take actions that support students.

The friends started to wonder:

"If this is such a common use case..."

"Could we combine efforts to build a set of open source tools that allow school systems to extract their data & use it to support students?"

"Could we pick a data standard to use so, that the work aligns?"
