# Pitch
*Write once, Use anywhere* 

Allow schools to use their own data.


Open source education ETLs [1] tools. 

Short story: Every school has a SIS [2], which contains all the info about students and teachers. Think tests scores, grades, attendance records, etc. There are a couple other places where student information gets stored. Alex Soble, in partnership with Somerville Public Schools, and myself, in partnership with KIPP NJ, realized that we were both writing the same ETL tools. 

Solution: Rather than writing custom, 1 off ETL scripts every time a data partner is working with a school, we can write a set of open source, standards based tools that can be used across the board. This would allow dashboards, analysis, and other tools to be reused without significant modifications from district to district. 

[1] Extract Transform Load, the process of getting data out of some system, cleaning it up, and inserting it into a new system. See Dave Guarino's ETL for America piece on why this is important if you haven't already, it really influenced a lot of my thinking on the issue.
