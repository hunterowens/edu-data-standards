## 05-28-15 Conference Call

Attendees: CFA Sommerville Team, Hunter Owens (Impact Lab), Andrew Martin (KIPP NJ), Chris Haid (KIPP Chicago)

"NEXT STEPS" TYPE THINGS (I.E. THINGS WE SAID WE'D DO)
	* Data standard decision: do we go with Ed-Fi?
	* Give ourselves 2 weeks to research & discuss
	* Next week:  Folks research, contribute their thoughts
	* Week after:  Make a decision
	* Three buckets:  No, Soft Yes, Hard Yes
	* Hunter organizes this process
* App gallery:  let's get our apps in one place so people can see what kinds of things they could do with their SIS data once it's more interoperable
	* Alex will add some Somerville app screenshots
## Minimum viable interoperability
* Can CfA stand up a KIPP app for Somerville?
* Can KIPP stand up the CfA app for KIPP schools?

## OTHER NOTES (I.E. THINGS WE SAID)
"Trying to understand college readiness at scale" —Andrew
"Mint.com for college readiness"  —Hunter
College readiness tool will be done in November  —Hunter
Hunter:
Every district has its own unique set of SISes, 3rd party tools
But the data itself in common in terms of what it’s about
EdFi standard — mandatory in Texas now?
Andrew:
One of the reasons there’s a need for this is the scope is bigger than what the commercial services do already
Clever exists but it’s not in the business of a student's full academic history
I don’t think about this as being a funky competitor to Clever — not a giant killer
Let’s do something open source for schools
There are bunch of ad hoc scripts running against databases, but they’re not exporting to a common standard yet
“Like an old telephone switchboard.” 
Chris:
Concern: developers don’t usually think about an education data level
You run into this weird problem where the products that get written for edtech — testing or teaching products — they don’t even know to go look for a standard
The people buying those products are not the people on the call right now
Hunter:
Everybody’s solving the same problems, like exporting to Powerschool
Andrew:
We’re a bunch of organizations with common interests & common problems
Chris’s skepticism, I also share it
But there has to be a home for this
Chris:
Schoolzilla, went to their data conference — one thing that came up was EdFi
Andrew:
We have some super tricked out Excel dashboards
They date back to 2008
Sortable view, clickthrough, drill down, if you click to a student you get a full page student profile
Alex:
We are building the same product for Somerville!
Except as a web product, not Excel
Let's make an app gallery so that people who make decisions about this can see what it means
